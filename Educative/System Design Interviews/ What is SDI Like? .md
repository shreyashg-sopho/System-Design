# Understanding System Design Interviews (SDIs)

## Overview
System Design Interviews (SDIs) evaluate your ability to design complex, scalable systems. This guide covers key aspects of SDIs and provides strategies for success.

### Topics Covered:
- Differences between SDIs and other interviews
- Approaching a design question
- Presenting the high-level design
- Common questions in SDIs
- Evolution of system designs (e.g., Google)
- Design challenges
- Responsibilities of a designer
- Who typically gets an SDI?
- Balancing theory and practice

## How are SDIs Different from Other Interviews?
SDIs focus on high-level design rather than coding. You’ll outline requirements and how different parts of a system interact. The process and your problem-solving approach are more important than the final answer.

## Tackling a Design Question
Design questions in SDIs are open-ended and mimic real-world scenarios. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Clarify Requirements:** Ask questions to solidify the problem’s scope.
2. **Scope the Problem:** Focus on core functionalities to manage time effectively.
3. **Engage with the Interviewer:** Maintain clear communication to explain your thought process.

### Example:
Designing a simplified version of WhatsApp. Focus on key features due to time constraints, and mention the exclusion of other features.

## Presenting the High-Level Design
At a high level, design components like frontend, load balancers, caches, and data processing units. Use diagrams to represent components as boxes and their interactions with arrows.

## Common Questions in SDIs
Interviewers might ask about system scalability, handling increased load, and evolving the design. Understanding trade-offs and justifying design decisions is crucial.

### Example Questions:
- How does the design handle a 10x increase in users?
- Why not over-design the system initially to handle future growth?

## Design Evolution Example: Google
Early versions of Google Search were simple yet sophisticated, balancing cost and functionality. Design decisions impact both business and customer satisfaction.

## Design Challenges
Designing systems involves making assumptions and preparing for inevitable changes and failures. Providing fault tolerance and ensuring resilience is key.

## Designer Responsibilities
Designers must create fault-tolerant systems using reliable components. This involves planning for failures and maintaining system integrity for users.

## Who Gets a System Design Interview?
Typically, SDIs are for mid-to-senior level candidates with over two years of experience. However, some companies now include SDIs for junior candidates as well.

## Balancing Theory and Practice
A solid understanding of distributed systems is beneficial. Key principles include robustness, scalability, availability, performance, extensibility, and resilience. Familiarity with terms like the CAP theorem can enhance communication with interviewers.


Remember, the goal is to demonstrate your design skills and thought process during the interview.
