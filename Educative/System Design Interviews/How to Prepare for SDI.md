# How to Prepare for Success in System Design Interviews

## Overview
Effective preparation is key to succeeding in System Design Interviews (SDIs). This guide covers essential preparation guidelines and materials.

### Topics Covered:
- This course
- Technical blogs
- Asking why a system works
- The right direction
- Mock interviews

Preparation can take different times for different people. On average, three to four months might be needed to prepare for an SDI.

## This Course
This course is designed to help you learn or brush up on system design skills. It includes traditional and new design problems to cover a wide range of topics.

## Technical Blogs
Many companies share technical details of their work through blogs. These blogs offer insights into the challenges companies face and the solutions they implement.

### Why Do Companies Share Technical Details?
Companies share their work to showcase their innovations and solutions. However, they maintain a balance between what can be shared and what remains confidential for competitive reasons.

### Recommended Blogs:
- Engineering at Meta
- Meta Research
- AWS Architecture Blog
- Amazon Science Blog
- Netflix TechBlog
- Google Research
- Engineering at Quora
- Uber Engineering Blog
- Databricks Blog
- Pinterest Engineering
- BlackRock Engineering
- Lyft Engineering
- Salesforce Engineering

**Tip:** Critically analyze these blogs and discuss any unclear points with peers.

## Ask Why a System Works
Understanding why systems work the way they do helps in thinking through complex situations. Here’s how to approach it:

1. **Learn Popular Applications:** Study how apps like Instagram and Twitter work at a high level.
2. **Understand Component Choices:** For example, why use Firebase instead of SQL?
3. **Build Side Projects:** Start with a simple product and refine it.
4. **Clone Popular Applications:** Try building them without tutorials to understand the process deeply.

## The Right Direction
Focus on high-level design and trade-offs rather than low-level mechanics. For example, discuss the trade-offs between using MySQL and MongoDB rather than whether to use a specific library.

## Mock Interviews
Mock interviews are a great way to prepare. You can:

1. Pair up with a friend to ask each other questions.
2. Record yourself acting as both interviewer and interviewee, then critique yourself or ask for feedback from a knowledgeable friend.

**Tip:** Real interviews are invaluable. After a few, you’ll better understand what went right and what didn’t.
