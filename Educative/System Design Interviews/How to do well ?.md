## What to Do During the Interview
To stand out, avoid presenting a common, unoriginal design. Instead, have a strategic plan. Here’s a recommended approach:

### Strategize, then Divide and Conquer
Include the following activities during the interview:

#### Ask Refining Questions
Understand the design problem and its requirements by asking the interviewer refining questions. This helps prioritize the main features and ensures you’re solving the right problem.

#### Handle Data
Identify and understand data characteristics to choose appropriate storage systems and processing components. Consider:
- Data size and growth rate
- Consumption by subsystems or end users
- Read-heavy or write-heavy data
- Consistency requirements
- Durability targets
- Privacy and regulatory requirements

#### Discuss the Components
Figure out which components to use, where to place them, and how they’ll interact. Components might include databases, front-end elements, load balancers, caches, and CDNs. Define user-facing APIs at a high level to understand system data and interaction requirements.

#### Discuss Trade-offs
Design problems have multiple solutions. Discuss the pros and cons of different components and their costs in terms of money and technical complexity. Point out weaknesses in your design and have a follow-up plan to tackle them. Integrate fault tolerance and security into your design.

## What Not to Do in an Interview
Avoid these pitfalls:
- Don’t write code.
- Don’t start building without a plan.
- Don’t work in silence.
- Don’t describe numbers without context.
- Don’t pretend to know something you don’t.

If unfamiliar with a system, be honest. The interviewer may explain it or change the question.
